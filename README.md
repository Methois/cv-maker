# CV Maker by Methois

![CV Maker Preview](https://github.methois.dev/IMG/cvmaker.png)

When I wanted to apply for a new job and create a CV, I realized it wasnâ€™t as easy as it seemed! Almost every website that lets you create a professional CV requires a payment. So, I thought: "This can be done differently!" and thatâ€™s how this repository came to be.

ðŸš§ **This is a Work in Progress!** Itâ€™s not finished yet, but it will be soon ;)


## To-Do List

- [ ] Add variables for customizable names and details.
- [ ] Improve the styling for better user experience.
- [ ] Implement backend functionality for saving CVs.
- [ ] Test the site across different browsers and devices.
- [ ] Optimize the site for mobile use.
- [ ] Write documentation for setup and usage.
- [ ] Gather user feedback for improvements.

## Demo

## Disclaimer

This site is built as-is, without any variables for customizing names or other details. If you want to change these, youâ€™ll need to dive into the code yourself!

## How to Use This?

Since everything is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, itâ€™s easy for almost anyone to run.
