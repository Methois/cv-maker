# CV Maker by Methois

When I wanted to apply for a new job and create a CV, I realized it wasnâ€™t as easy as it seemed! Almost every website that lets you create a professional CV requires a payment. So, I thought: "This can be done differently!" and thatâ€™s how this repository came to be.

ðŸš§ **This is a Work in Progress!** Itâ€™s not finished yet, but it will be soon ;)

## Demo

If youâ€™d like to preview this site before downloading, thatâ€™s definitely possible. Hereâ€™s a link to the demo:
[Demo](https://cv.methois.dev/)

## Disclaimer

This site is built as-is, without any variables for customizing names or other details. If you want to change these, youâ€™ll need to dive into the code yourself!

## How to Use This?

Since everything is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, itâ€™s easy for almost anyone to run.

## Need Help?

Feel free to reach out if you have questions! Add me on Discord (Methois) or send an email to info@methois.dev.
